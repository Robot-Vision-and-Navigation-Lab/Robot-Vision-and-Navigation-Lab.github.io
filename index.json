Especially with the development of data-driven technology, the combination of data-driven VO and model-based VO has achieved accurate tracking performance. However, the lack of generalization of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNN) limits the robustness of such a combination in unseen environments. In this study, we introduce a novel framework with appropriate usage of DNN prediction and improve the robustness in the self-driving application. Based on the characteristic of on-road self-driving motion and the DNN output, we propose a two-step optimization strategy with a variable degree of freedom (DoF), i.e., the use of two types of DoF representations during pose estimation. Speciﬁcally, our two-step optimization operates according to the residual of the optimization with the motion label classiﬁcation from the pre-trained DNN, as well as our proposed Motion Evaluation by essential matrix construction. Experimental results show that our framework obtains better tracking accuracy than the existing methods.","tags":null,"title":"Robustness Improvement of Using Pre-Trained Network in Visual Odometry for On-Road Driving","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"557dc08fd4b672a0c08e0a8cf0c9ff7d","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/preprint/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
