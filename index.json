I have worked in a number of areas in robotics and, for the past 10+ years, my focus has been on visual robot navigation. In 2003-17, with support from the federal and provinncial goverments, I held an NSERC Industrial Research Chair to conduct research in computer vision and image processing that addresses the practical challenges facing Alberta’s mining industry. As a member of the NSERC Strategic Network on Robotics (NCRN) I work closely with Canadian academic colleagues and industrial partners on mobile robotics research. Within the international robotics community, my activities include a variety of roles in ICRA and IROS communities, as well as other IEEE RAS sponsored conferences.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9ba420b8ac562a35c57569aeb0c48f01","permalink":"https://robot-vision-and-navigation-lab.github.io/author/hong-zhang/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/hong-zhang/","section":"authors","summary":"I was a Professor in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta.

Especially with the development of data-driven technology, the combination of data-driven VO and model-based VO has achieved accurate tracking performance. However, the lack of generalization of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNN) limits the robustness of such a combination in unseen environments. In this study, we introduce a novel framework with appropriate usage of DNN prediction and improve the robustness in the self-driving application. Based on the characteristic of on-road self-driving motion and the DNN output, we propose a two-step optimization strategy with a variable degree of freedom (DoF), i.e., the use of two types of DoF representations during pose estimation. Speciﬁcally, our two-step optimization operates according to the residual of the optimization with the motion label classiﬁcation from the pre-trained DNN, as well as our proposed Motion Evaluation by essential matrix construction. Experimental results show that our framework obtains better tracking accuracy than the existing methods.","tags":null,"title":"Robustness Improvement of Using Pre-Trained Network in Visual Odometry for On-Road Driving","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://robot-vision-and-navigation-lab.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://robot-vision-and-navigation-lab.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5067e3c181b3e0650396f57d3552e7e3","permalink":"https://robot-vision-and-navigation-lab.github.io/research_highlights/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research_highlights/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"}]
